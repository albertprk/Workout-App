# Swolr

Swolr is a web application that is designed to introduce trainees to trainers, newbies to gyms, and lifters to lifting partners. 

There are four pages.

==============================================================================

## Gyms Page:

In the upper part, we see a map with gyms. (In phase one, we use a photo instead)
In the lower part, we see a list of gyms with its information such as picture, location, hours. 
In either part, when we click one gym, the page is redirect to Trainers page.

==============================================================================

## Trainers page:
We see a list of trainers with default filter of location. 
We see a list of trainers with their brief introduction such as Picture, Name, Gym Locations, Introduction, workout tags
We should be able to filer trainers by workout type (yoga, bodybuilding etc), location, Price, Gender
Once we click the specific trainer, the page is redirect to Trainer Page.


==============================================================================

## Trainer Page:
We see the detail information of the trainer such as Availability (Text at first, Calendar format in the second phase), Workout tags(eg. Arms, legs, Chest), introduction, Picture 


==============================================================================

## User Profile Page:
